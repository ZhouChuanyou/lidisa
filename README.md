# lidisa

`lidisa` is a **li**ghtweight implementation of **di**rect **s**ampling in Python. This is a simplified version of the algorithm described in *The Direct Sampling method to perform multiple‚Äêpoint geostatistical simulations* published by Mariethoz, Renard and Straubhaar in *Water Resources Research* (2010). It requires only `numpy` and `numba` as dependencies and makes use of the `numba` just-in-time compiler to significantly speed up sampling. `lidisa` is able to conduct both conditional and unconditional sampling of new images based on training data. Using it is simple:

`training_image = ...`
`simulator = lidisa.dsampler(training_image, iterations=5')``
`simulations = [x for x in simulator]`

Currently, `lidisa` supports only categorical-valued images. Images with continuous values will be supported in a future release. See the attached Jupyter notebook for a detailed example workflow using `lidisa` to conduct stochastic simulation.
